=======


This ViewHelper prevents rendering of any content inside the tag
Note: Contents of the comment will still be **parsed** thus throwing an
Exception if it contains syntax errors. You can put child nodes in
CDATA tags to avoid this.

= Examples =

<code title="Commenting out fluid code">
Before
<f:comment>
  This is completely hidden.
  <f:debug>This does not get rendered</f:debug>
</f:comment>
After
</code>
<output>

<code title="Prevent parsing">
<f:comment><![CDATA[
 <f:some.invalid.syntax />
]]></f:comment>
</code>
<output>
</output>

Note: Using this view helper won't have a notable effect on performance, especially once the template is parsed.
However it can lead to reduced readability. You can use layouts and partials to split a large template into smaller
parts. Using self-descriptive names for the partials can make comments redundant.
